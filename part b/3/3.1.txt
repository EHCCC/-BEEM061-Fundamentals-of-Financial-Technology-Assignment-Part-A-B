the fourth part, JupyterLab, analyzes the data using the machine learning model built
  

The user fills in the information in the app designed by Streamlit UI into machine language and data, 
 the data is referenced by the machine learning model lock used by FASTAPI,   
then JupyterLab is used to analyse the data using the built machine learning model, and finally returned to the customer via Postgres.
